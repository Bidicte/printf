# 0x11. C - printf

This is a collaboration project between [Eko ABET](https://github.com/Pacific1990/) and [MOUSSA VEKETO Alexandra Bénédicte](https://github.com/Bidicte) for the Software Engineering program.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create a custom printf function, similar to the one defined in the c stdio.h library. The function should be able to take in various arguments and print formatted output to the console. The function will be implemented in C programming language.

## Project Structure

- `main` directory: Contains the source code files for the printf function and other folders
- `tests` directory: Contains test files for testing the functionality of the printf function
- `README.md`file: Contains information about the project

## How to Use

- Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Pacific1990/printf.git`
- Navigate to the `tests` directory
- compile the c files using your preferred C compiler or use this code:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c ../*.c
```
- copy the `main.h` file to the `tests/` directory and copile again incase of errors
- Run the compiled file
